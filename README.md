# CodePath Group Project - Pet Social Media

Short Description: This app is intended for animal lovers who enjoy viewing/posting pictures/video of animals of all kinds. It will basically
be a social media app where users can interact with each other and form a community of people with common interests. 


This version of the app was extended by me, Eduardo Carrillo.

I removed the Parse dependencies and implemented my own custom backend using Node.js server. You can find the server here https://github.com/EddieCurio/PetServer
